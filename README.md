# 3 AM Buddy – AI Mental Health Support Bot

3 AM Buddy is an experimental AI-driven mental health support assistant designed to provide empathetic, context-aware conversations using modern NLP and generative AI techniques. The project focuses on conversational flow, sentiment understanding, and supportive dialogue patterns for emotional well-being.

This repository contains the exported development notebook and initial research groundwork for the system.

---

## 1. Project Overview

3 AM Buddy is built as a prototype that explores:
- AI-based emotional support
- NLP-powered mood and sentiment understanding
- Safe and context-sensitive response generation
- Conversational grounding logic for stress relief
- Modular design for future expansion into a full product

The goal is to demonstrate how AI can assist with mental well-being by offering a supportive conversational companion during late-night anxiety moments (“3 AM thoughts”).
